What does it actually say about it?", "response": " Yes, the bill specifically mentions TikTok multiple times.

Therefore, TikTok falls under the scope of this legislation as a foreign adversary controlled application. The bill goes on to regulate the distribution, maintenance, and updating of these applications within the United States, as well as requiring data portability prior to prohibitions.", "tweet_id": "112238137437168470", "from_username": "orbital_sfear", "full_url": "https://static-test-demo.netlify.app/questions/112238137437168470", "completed": false}
